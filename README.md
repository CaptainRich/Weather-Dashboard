## Project Objective
As a traveler I want the ability to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a 'weather dashboard' with form inputs:

1) WHEN I search for a city, THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that 
city and that city is added to the search history.
2) WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city, THEN I am presented with the city name, 
the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind 
speed, and the UV index.
3) WHEN I view the UV index, THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the 
conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
4) WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city, THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast 
that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the 
humidity.
6) WHEN I click on a city in the search history, THEN I am again presented with current and future 
conditions for that city.
